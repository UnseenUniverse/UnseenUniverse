Then gather followers in hopes of summoning the deity to defeat the opposing cults. First your opposing cults, then the world! Presented at Stout Game Expo in Spring 2023. As Project Manager I managed the other 3 team members tasks and made marketing material for the Expo. I also made sure the graphic design of paper parts of the game was consistent.
